        <h2>How it Started</h2>
        <p>The first time I played volleyball was in the 8th grade. I tried out for my middle school team and I suprisingly made it despite having no experience. I quickly became attached to the sport and decided I would continue playing after middle school. When I came to Stuyvesant, I made a bunch of new friends that also played volleyball. We played afterschool everyday in hopes that we would make the Varsity team. When tryouts came, we all played our best and made the team. We had daily practices and the team participated in many events including the Women's Day Run. We were about to have our first scrimmage of the season and it got canceled along with the whole season because of corona.</p>
