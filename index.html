        <h2>How it Started</h2>
        <p>The first time I played volleyball was in the 8th grade. I tried out for my middle school team and I suprisingly made it despite having no experience. I quickly became attached to the sport and decided I would continue playing after middle school. When I came to Stuyvesant, I made a bunch of new friends that also played volleyball. We played afterschool everyday in hopes that we would make the Varsity team. When tryouts came, we all played our best and made the team. We had daily practices and the team participated in many events including the Women's Day Run. We were about to have our first scrimmage of the season and it got canceled along with the whole season because of corona.</p>

        <h2>Playing During Rona Times</h2>
        <p>After school became online, I stopped going outside. Once the cases died down, my friends and I decided to play grass volleyball. We started to go play everyday and I met a lot of new friends that share the same love for volleyball. My friends hosted a tournament and my teammate and I placed 2nd in our divison! </p>

        <h2>Club Team</h2>
        <p>In October, I joined a volleyball club called New York City Volleyball Academy with our fellow classmate Nurdaulet. We have both improved a lot since joining the team. Our team has played our first 3 scrimmages and it's looking good. We are looking forward to attending our first tournament next week! </p>
